In the previous project, you learned that HTML provides the structure and content of a website using different 'tags'. In this project we are focusing on one specific type of HTML tag: ```<div>```.

The ```<div>``` tag is used to create a division or section in an HTML document. Think of ```<div>``` as creating a container into which you can put other HTML elements and style them together using CSS. Any sort of content can be put inside a ```<div>``` tag.

Have a look at the code in the first tab, ```index.html```. You'll see that the usual header information is included in the ```<head>``` tag. 

Inside the body of the website, you should see the ```<h1>``` tag that contains the heading, followed by a tag which says ```<div class=div1>```. This tag creates the division in your webpage, which we have called **div1**. The division ends at the ```</div>``` tag, and everything between these two tags can be styled using the ```style.css``` stylesheet.
